    "  - For this project, we will focus on variables that capture emotional intensity, memory recall, and the sentiment expressed while describing personal memories. Each observation represents a segmented portion of a participant’s autobiographical memory. The participant and gender variables provide basic demographic context, while the cue word identifies whether the memory is about a happy or sad experience. The emotional_memory_duration variable (converted to seconds) serves as a proxy for the level of recollection detail, since longer descriptions likely indicate more elaborate recall. Emotional experience is measured using past_valence and present_valence, which capture how positive or negative the event felt when it happened and how it feels now when being recalled, both on a scale from −1 (very negative) to +1 (very positive). Finally, sentiment_m and sentiment_sd quantify the emotional tone and variability of the language used during storytelling. The original study used an affective word lexicon where each emotional word received a score from −1 (negative) to +1 (positive). For each sentence in a memory segment, the mean sentiment score (sentiment_m) and the variability of sentiment (sentiment_sd) were calculated. So sentiment_m represents overall positivity/negativity of language, while sentiment_sd reflects variation in emotional wording."

Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",
    "   2. If there are any major concerns with the dataset, describe them. For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\"\n",

    "#### Overview of the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Remembering Past Emotions](https://ssh.datastations.nl/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.17026/SS/6EGKHT) dataset is a de-identified dataset derived from the paper *\"Remembering Past Emotions.\"* It contains data from **17 participants** who discussed both happy and sad autobiographical memories. The  dataset contains segment-level data from **autobiographical emotional memories.** Each row represents a segment of a memory narrative, rather than a full participant response. This is important because it allows us to analyze how emotional expression varies within a single memory as people talk about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, we can focus on a subset of variables that directly relate to our research question about emotional intensity and memory recall. The dataset includes demographic variables such as **Age** and **Gender,** as well as the topic of the memory (coded as happy or sad). Each memory was also rated on **Past Valence** (how the participant felt when the event originally happened) and **Present Valence** (how they feel when recalling it now). These values capture how emotional memories change over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset also includes measures that help quantify how vividly and emotionally memories are recalled. For example, the variable *Emotional_memory_duration* measures how long participants spoke about each memory segment (in time units), which can serve as a proxy for how much detail they recall. The dataset also includes a *sentiment score* derived from the language used during recall, which helps quantify the emotional tone of the narrative. These variables can allow us to explore how emotional intensity (defined by emotional memory duration and sentiment score) relates to how people describe personal experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is particularly useful for our research question because the data is segmented and includes both valence ratings and narrative features (duration and sentiment). We can examine whether stronger emotions are associated with longer, more detailed, or more emotionally charged recollections.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are important limitations. The dataset contains only **17 participants,** and most fall within a **very narrow age range (approximately late 60s to early 70s).** This means the dataset is not suitable for making strong claims about age differences, and any findings should be interpreted as exploratory rather than generalizable. For this reason, we will most likely not use the age demographic, and can look at whether gender is a factor. "
